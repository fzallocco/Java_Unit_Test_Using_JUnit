Assignment: 3, question 2

I uploaded seven java files for unit testing, six of which are dependent on the parent class, JunitTesting.
In the class above, three methods are generally defined, and the purpose of testing them with various inputs is to help users understand the behavior of said methods.
This repository has two divide classes, two square classes, one string class, and an all-test class, limited to evaluating the two division classes.
In each class, except for the string class, I test positive and negative integers to study how the methods alert users in case of output mismatch or reassure them of an otherwise correct result.
To conduct your analysis, you must first compile JunitTesting.java and repeat the process for divideTest, divideATest, squareTest, negativesqrTest, stringTest, and AllTest java files.
Once all files have been converted into .class equivalents, you may run divideTest and divideATest either individually or in unison through AllTest. In both cases, you will appreciate that the divide method from JunitTesting acts as expected and alerts the user when the output does not match the arithmetic result. Similarly, you could study the behavior of squareTest, negativesqrTest, and stringTest
